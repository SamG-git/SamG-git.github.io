Running AC Valhalla Using Proton
================================

If, like me, you've purchased AC Valhalla using the Ubisoft Connect store rather than through Steam, getting it to run on Linux can be a challenge. This can be complicated further if you use Nvidia drivers. The rough required steps are as follows:

1. Set-up Ubisoft Connect as an external app on Steam. This can be achieved by:
    a. Downloading the Windows installer for Ubisoft Connect.
    b. Setting this up as an external Steam app.
    c. Running it using Protol Experimental.
    d. Installing Ubisoft Connect.
    c. Changing the executable to the newly installed Ubisoft Connect.

2. Log-in to Ubisoft Connect and download AC Valhalla.
3. (If Nvidia) Use some form of external FPS limiting software (e.g.mangohud) to limit the FPS of the game. This will prevent run a run condition which crashes the game.
