Bravia 2 Development Board on Ubuntu 22.04
==========================================

Diamond Installation
--------------------

To get Diamond, you first need to get an account with Lattice Semiconductor.
This will allow you to Download the software, ut you need to wait about 2 days
for your account to be verified before you can also download the free license.

When you have the license downloaded, go to the Diamond download page and grab
the latest .rpm version. This is over 1GB in size so it may take some time to
download. Once downloaded, install ``alien`` using:

``sudo apt install alien``

Now, convert the rpm file using:

``sudo alien --scripts ~/Downloads/diamond.....rpm``

You can now install Diamond using:

``sudo apt install ./Downloads/diamond.......deb``

Before Diamond can be launched its sole dependency needs to be installed:

``sudo apt install lsb``

Furthermore, some modifications to the license file are required. First, change
the string ``daemon_path`` to your systems hostname. Finally, change the 
string ``path_to_mgcld`` to ``/usr/local/diamond/3.13/modeltech/linuxloem``. 

Now, launch the license server using:

``/usr/local/diamond/VERSION/ispfpga/bin/lin64/lmgrd -l /usr/local/diamond/VERSION/license/license.log -c /usr/local/diamond/VERSION/license/license.dat``

In a separate terminal, launch Diamond using:

``/usr/local/diamond/VERSION/bin/lin64/diamond``

Building the Demo Project
-------------------------

First, download the demo project from the Lattice Bravia2 web-page. The project
comes with a number of issues which need to be fixed before it can be built.

First, rename the file ``demo_latticexp2_brevia_soc.lpf`` in ``project`` to
``Demo_latticexp2_brevia_soc.lpf``. Second, rename all the top level folders to
start with a lower case letter. 

Now you can import the project into Diamond and it should work. To build the
project, click on the Process tab on the left-hand-side and double click on
synthesize
