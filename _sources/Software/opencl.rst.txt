OpenCL Notes
============

Installation
------------

On Ubuntu 22.04 run the following command to install OpenCL. Note this only works when you have an Nvidia GPU and the proprietary drivers installed.

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo apt install nvidia-cuda-toolkit clinfo


You can now restart you PC and use the ``clinfo`` command to verify the installation.
