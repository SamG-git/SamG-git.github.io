Installing GTest
================

GTest is a C++ testing framework developed by google. It can either be installed from the package manager or compiled from source. This tutorial will show you how to install it from source.

Getting GTest
-------------

Google open-source gtest `here <https://github.com/google/googletest>`_.

Compiling GTest for the host system
-----------------------------------

Inside the googletest directory, create the build and install directory and enter the build directory using

.. code-block:: bash

    mkdir build
    mkdir install
    cd build

Now configure the project and start compilation using:

.. code-block:: bash

    cmake ..
    make

Finally, install using

.. code-block::bash
    make install DESTDIR=../install/

Cross-Compiling GTest
---------------------

To cross compile gtest you will need to make sure you have a clean copy of the source code. This can either be done by cloning a new version of the repository or by removing the ``build`` and ``install`` directories from your current copy.

Once you have a clean copy of the source, create the build and install directories and enter the build directory using:

.. code-block:: bash

    mkdir build
    mkdir install
    cd build

Now configure ``cmake`` to use your cross-compiler. In this case I will be using  ``arm-linux-gnueabi`` as my cross-compiler prefix.

.. code-block:: bash

    cmake .. -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=arm-linux-gnueabi-gcc \
             -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=arm-linux-gnueabi-g++

Now build and install gtest using

.. code-block:: bash

    make
    make install DESTDIR=../install/
